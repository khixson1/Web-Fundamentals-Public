/*MVP
As a diligent student, I want to reward myself if I finish my homework, and 
based on the time of day:

I want a latte if it's before 10 am
I want a hot chocolate it's between 10 am and 4 pm
I want ice cream between 4 pm - 10 pm.
If it's after 10 pm, I don't want anything other than sleep!*/

//FEATURE 1
//Create function with 2 parameters to test if you get reward and which reward you get depending on hour of the day

    //convert time to AMPM time
